## **Executive Summary**

### The Platform Problem 

The global platform economy has shown a powerful way to organize flexible matchmaking between supply and demand. For the consumer, it is less of a problem that the coordinating platform owner gets to unilaterally set the rules of engagement and on top of this also all the data from the transactions.

For enterprises, however, existing such platform arrangements work less well as a means of doing business since it immediately divides—first the platform owner and then everyone else. Generally, the challenge for organizations to engage in effective yet flexible, collaborative ecosystems almost always comes at a high cost, which can take many forms: the intermediary organizing firm holds all the power, one firm over time gets the upper hand, and collaboration requires sharing too much critical data with potential competitors. 

As of 2024, over 50 permissionless DLT protocols have emerged, and over 15,000 crypto-currency tokens have contributed to over $3 trillion in market cap, attracting over 300m+ users. Permissionless DLT platforms have shown a way of coordinating parties in a trustless way. However, a fragmented regulatory landscape for permissionless DLT networks, and rising macro pressures on institutions to find continued technological efficiencies and grow revenues, has caused institutions to explore permissioned DLT’s, in the hopes of unlocking over $16tn in illiquid markets by 2030, some of which can be found *within* the organisation.

## The Tokenization Opportunity

This report presents a novel way of resolving this issue of strategic importance — tokenization. At its core, tokenization allows a group of organizations to collaborate flexibly in a digital consortium by agreeing on the transformation of particular digital data objects to become claims against the consortium. This can, for example, be a digitized asset or the reference to a particular form containing vital information. Distributed ledger technology (DLT) will ensure that these claims are recorded appropriately in a shared ledger to be inspected by the appropriate party or all consortium members. This distributed ledger represents a shared, consolidated, ground truth and can help resolve the double-spend problem where two or more entities make identical claims. In the physical world, the physical object itself resolves the double-spend problem – once you have handed over a banknote to someone, you can no longer claim it as yours. For digital assets of all kinds, it is easy to resolve this problem through a centralized database, for example, a bank keeping the ledger on what funds are in your account. However, for digital data representing claims between firms, none of these two solutions are acceptable — digital data is easy to replicate, and keeping a centralized ledger brings us back to the essential problem with digital platforms coordinating the collaboration, namely the centralization of all the transactional data. 

### Initiating the Journey

This report aims to support managers in taking the first steps in the tokenization journey. We do so firstly by explaining the strategic potential of tokenization in terms of a balanced approach to inter-organizational ecosystems, which through consensus establishes an equal playing field for all participants. A shared understanding from the ideation phase among organizations of the 'why' behind this setup is essential for creating strategically important collaboration across organizational boundaries and is critical to the success of the endeavor.. Tokenization enables removing inter-organizational friction while at the same time protecting critical informational assets. It can also support radical business model innovation. 

### Four Foundational Pillars

The report proposes the Tokenization Canvas made up of four fundamental pillars defining the primary areas of concern: **1) The Business Object** that enables the creation and transfer of a claim, represented by a token, within the inter-organizational community; **2) The Inter-Organizational Arrangement** defining the collaboration; **3) The Governance** of the arrangement; and **4) The Strategic Impact** of tokenization in terms of the overall value created. The report exemplifies these four pillars through two real-world cases; Walmart’s DL Freight case, and the tokenization of the Aberdeen Standard Liquidity Fund.

### Threats 

The report also discusses tokenization risks, both the risks of hesitation, and the risks of going ahead. Considering similar developments as with the rapid growth of the digital platform economy, then the opportunities were initially wide open, yet dominant platforms rapidly emerged. After Apple and Google established the two smartphone app stores, there was no space for a third, despite Microsoft sinking billions of dollars into the competition annually. Failing to take tokenization seriously can not only result in missed opportunities for operation inefficiencies, missed innovation potential, and sub-optimal resource utilization. It can also result in missed opportunities for reshaping ecosystems of flexible collaboration and innovation. 

When that is said, then there are also new risks of engaging in tokenization and experience shows that the primary one is governance, which the report discusses in detail in terms of the challenges of shared governance, sustaining good governance, and securing stakeholder engagement. 

### Mapping the Future  

It is our hope that the main part of this report will wet your appetite for a hopefully exciting and prosperous tokenization journey by explaining and exemplifying why such processes will be standard for all organizations as the stable of engaging in complex business ecosystems. You will then, hopefully, be enticed to move beyond reading the report and into the Appendix where the real work awaits. Here, you will find a detailed unfolding of the four pillars into the Tokenization Canvas, which on the surface may feel familiar to those with experience in the original Business Model Canvas. You will here also find a document explaining the basic terminology of distributed ledger technology to help make the concepts easy to understand, as well as an atlas of 50 or so tokenization cases across sectors. As a final resource, we encourage reading further as part of the tokenization journey and have carefully selected a few books, reports and articles all listed in the order we find most appropriate and with a few words associated with each reading. 

At the time it did not seem revolutionary when both Amazon and the Netscape Navigator web browser hit the world in 1994, and when Apple in 2008 launched the iOS app store. However, in hindsight these and many other business technology launches turned out to provide templates for dramatic changes to come. It is difficult to clearly mark where in such a trajectory tokenization is located, but what is evident to us is that few if any enterprises can turn their back to this technological innovation, when they rather should seek to embrace it, experiment with it, and in the process help create the future of flexible business ecosystems.

### 7.0 Appendix 

This Appendix contains material for further tokenization work in your organization. Some of the material is accessible online through download links. 

#### 7.1 Detailed Tokenization Canvas

The following outlines the Tokenization Canvas, First we outline the four pillars of tokenization in more detail than in the main report text (7.1.1). Then the Tokenization Canvas is presented and elaborated in its totality through a detailed description of all the elements (7.1.2). Finally, we privacy an empty Tokenization Canvas for your own use (7.1.3). 

##### 7.1.1 Detailed Outline of the Four Pillars of the Tokenization Canvas

##### **A Business Object**

The business object pillar focuses on the core process that enables the creation and transfer of claims against the inter-organizational community. This involves identifying the specific assets, rights, or data that will be tokenized and ensuring that these tokens can be securely and efficiently transferred between parties.

*Key Aspects:*

- **Token Creation**: Define the assets or rights to be tokenized, such as financial assets, supply chain data, intellectual property, or service credits.
- **Claim Transfer**: Establish mechanisms for the seamless transfer of these claims or tokens between different entities within the network.
- **Security and Integrity**: Implement cryptographic techniques and blockchain technology to ensure the authenticity and immutability of tokens.
- **Compliance**: Ensure that the tokenization process adheres to relevant legal and regulatory requirements.

##### **B Inter-Organizational Arrangement**

In the context of tokenization, an inter-organizational arrangement refers to the collaborative framework in which multiple organizations work together to implement and utilize tokenization technology to enhance their joint operations and interactions. This pillar involves three elements: configuration, optimization, and transformation.

*Key Elements:*

- **Configuration**: The collaborative process of setting up and structuring business processes to integrate tokenization. Configuration defines roles, responsibilities, and interactions, as well as how tokens will be created, managed, and exchanged, in a context of both closed-loop (internal to the community) and open (external impact beyond the community) systems.
- **Optimization**: The strategic decision-making process where the involved organizations assess whether to use tokenization to improve (exploit) existing processes, such as asset tracking and management, or to create (explore) new processes, such as developing new financial instruments or market opportunities.
- **Transformation**: The modification of business models and operations based on the optimized configuration, leading to significant changes that enhance efficiency, security, transparency, and innovation across all organizations involved.

##### C Governance

Governance focuses on the structures, policies, and processes that ensure the effective and secure operation of the tokenized system. It addresses how to deliver tokenization value to inter-organizational systems through proper oversight and management.

*Key Aspects:*

- **Governance Structures**: Develop decentralized governance models that allow stakeholders to participate in decision-making processes.
- **Smart Contracts**: Utilize smart contracts to automate governance rules, reduce human error, and increase efficiency.
- **Dispute Resolution**: Establish clear mechanisms for resolving disputes that may arise within the tokenized network.
- **Transparency and Accountability**: Ensure all transactions and changes within the network are transparent and verifiable to maintain trust among participants.
- **Security Protocols**: Implement robust security measures to protect against fraud, cyber-attacks, and other vulnerabilities.

##### D Strategic Impact

This pillar assesses the overall value created by tokenization and the associated risks. It considers both the strategic benefits and potential challenges that come with implementing tokenization in an inter-organizational context.

*Key Aspects:*

- **Value Creation**: Evaluate the tangible and intangible benefits of tokenization, such as increased efficiency, reduced costs, enhanced trust, and new revenue streams.
- **Risk Management**: Identify and mitigate risks associated with tokenization, including technological, legal, and operational risks.
- **Competitive Advantage**: Analyze how tokenization can provide a competitive edge by enabling innovative business models and improving inter-organizational collaboration.
- **Long-term Viability**: Consider the sustainability and scalability of the tokenized system to ensure it can adapt and grow with changing business needs and technological advancements.
- **Stakeholder Impact**: Assess the impact of tokenization on various stakeholders, including employees, customers, and partners, to ensure broad-based benefits and acceptance.

#### 7.5 Methodological Considerations 

This work is the result of a combined effort targeting both academics and practitioners. The interview data from more than 200 interviews formed the empirical foundation for the work. Of these, around 60 were original interviews conducted by the research team, and the remaining 140 interviews constituted secondary data transcribed from publicly available sources. All 200 interviews related directly to tokenization and distributed ledger technologies. 

Immediately before and during the effort, the participants defended a PhD, a DBA, and an MSc, all closely related to the subject matter of this report. During the project, the participants produced the following output all accepted for publication: two book chapters in an esteemed collection of papers, a journal paper, and five conference abstracts. During the project, the participants also conducted over 20 keynotes, talks, and masterclasses with around 1000 C-suite executives, top managers, and academics presenting and discussing the opportunities and challenges of tokenization.
